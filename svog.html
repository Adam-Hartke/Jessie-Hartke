            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, independent music venues faced sudden and prolonged shutdowns that created immediate existential risk. Early federal relief programs failed to account for the operational realities of live performance businesses, leaving much of the sector initially ineligible for aid.</p>
            <p>In response, a nationwide coalition of independent venues organized through the National Independent Venue Association (NIVA) to coordinate advocacy, documentation, and operational alignment in support of targeted federal relief. The work required sustained coordination across thousands of independent operators, alignment of shared narratives and documentation, and disciplined operations under extreme time, financial, and regulatory pressure.</p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>I supported program leadership by coordinating coalition operations, documentation, and communication efforts, with a focus on translating policy ambiguity into actionable planning considerations.</p>
            <p>Key responsibilities included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Coordinating operational support across a large, distributed venue coalition</li>
                <li>Aligning shared documentation, messaging, and operational narratives across stakeholders</li>
                <li>Managing information flow as policy language, eligibility criteria, and timelines evolved</li>
                <li>Supporting advocacy operations contributing to federal relief passage</li>
                <li>Assisting with risk assessment, scenario planning, and communication during prolonged shutdowns</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Work</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Coordinated support across a nationwide coalition of 3,000+ independent venues and operators</li>
                <li>Organized shared documentation, talking points, and operational narratives used in advocacy efforts</li>
                <li>Tracked evolving policy language and eligibility considerations to inform coalition planning</li>
                <li>Translated regulatory uncertainty into practical operational considerations for venue operators</li>
                <li>Supported real-time communication documenting the operational impact of shutdowns</li>
                <li>Sustained coordination and information hygiene across an extended period of uncertainty</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Outcomes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Contributed to coordinated advocacy efforts supporting passage of a federal relief program totaling over $16 billion</li>
                <li>Supported alignment and shared understanding across a coalition of more than 3,000 independent venues nationwide</li>
                <li>Helped clarify sector-wide operational needs for policymakers through consistent documentation and narrative alignment</li>
                <li>Preserved continuity, coordination, and decision support across a highly distributed stakeholder environment</li>
                <li>Supported leadership decision-making during a prolonged period of systemic disruption</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Separate advocacy artifacts more clearly from implementation and compliance documentation</li>
