            <section class="section">
                <p>I'm a program manager who brings structure, clarity, and follow-through to complex, cross-functional work. I'm comfortable operating in ambiguity, but I don't romanticize it. My goal is to reduce uncertainty, protect teams, and move work forward sustainably.</p>

                <h3>Working Style</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Grounded, steady, and execution-focused</li>
                    <li>Comfortable in high-pressure environments without creating urgency for its own sake</li>
                    <li>Oriented toward systems, not heroics</li>
                    <li>Protective of team capacity and long-term sustainability</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="work-principles">
                <h3>Planning and Delivery</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Translate strategy into clear plans, timelines, dependencies, and milestones</li>
                    <li>Establish operating rhythms early and adjust them as reality changes</li>
                    <li>Track risks, surface tradeoffs, and escalate issues before they become blockers</li>
                    <li>Balance flexibility with guardrails to protect deadlines, budgets, and people</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="work-principles">
                <h3>Communication</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clear, direct, and context-rich</li>
                    <li>Prefer written artifacts that create shared understanding and reduce rework</li>
                    <li>Use meetings intentionally to resolve ambiguity, not perform alignment</li>
                    <li>Comfortable communicating internally and externally when clarity or trust is needed</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="work-principles">
                <h3>Decision Making</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Grounded in constraints, available data, and downstream impact</li>
                    <li>Willing to make decisions with incomplete information</li>
                    <li>Explicit about tradeoffs and assumptions</li>
                    <li>Adjust course when conditions change rather than defending sunk costs</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="work-principles">
                <h3>External Narrative and PR Collaboration</h3>

                    <li>Experienced partnering with communications, PR, and leadership teams</li>
                    <li>Approach external visibility as a tool to support programs, not an end in itself</li>
                    <li>Value scoped, intentional external communication over constant public presence</li>
                </ul>
