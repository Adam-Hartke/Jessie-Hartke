            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>Midtopia was created to support long-term sustainability within the independent music sector through education, programming, and partnership-driven initiatives. The organization operates in a fragmented, post-pandemic environment shaped by market consolidation and funding volatility, requiring disciplined program design, governance, and prioritization across a diverse stakeholder landscape.</p>
            <p>The work involves building and operating programs, governance, and operating systems from zero while balancing mission-driven objectives with operational rigor, financial accountability, and realistic capacity constraints. The organization continues to operate while actively managing program evolution and long-term sustainability decisions.</p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>I lead the design, launch, and ongoing operation of Midtopia's core programs and operating model.</p>
            <p>Key responsibilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designing and managing cross-functional programs spanning education, events, partnerships, and artist support</li>
                <li>Establishing governance structures, decision-making frameworks, and operating rhythms</li>
                <li>Owning budgets, forecasts, and financial oversight across programs</li>
                <li>Coordinating internal teams, external partners, funders, and community stakeholders</li>
                <li>Translating high-level strategy into executable plans under evolving constraints</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Work</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed operating models and program frameworks to support repeatable execution across initiatives</li>
                <li>Built planning artifacts, timelines, and dependency mapping to coordinate parallel workstreams</li>
                <li>Established budgeting, forecasting, and reporting structures to support financial discipline</li>
                <li>Led cross-functional collaboration across education, programming, marketing, and operations</li>
                <li>Managed program execution amid shifting funding conditions and external dependencies</li>
                <li>Documented learnings and iterated program design based on outcomes, constraints, and capacity</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Outcomes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Launched and continue to operate multiple cross-functional programs supporting artists and community partners</li>
                <li>Created durable operating systems enabling repeatable execution across initiatives</li>
                <li>Improved clarity and alignment across stakeholders through defined governance and planning structures</li>
