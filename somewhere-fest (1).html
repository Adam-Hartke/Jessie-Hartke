            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>Somewhere Fest & Conference is a large-scale, multi-day, multi-venue festival combining live music programming, conference content, and community engagement. The program operated under fixed, immovable deadlines, significant financial constraints, and a complex stakeholder environment including artists, venues, vendors, sponsors, nonprofit partners, and external production teams.</p>
            <p>Previously produced as Elsewhere Fest in 2024, the program evolved while maintaining consistent operational scope and delivery constraints.</p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>I led end-to-end program coordination and delivery across the festival and conference.</p>
            <p>Key responsibilities included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Owning the integrated program plan across programming, operations, finance, and marketing</li>
                <li>Establishing timelines, dependencies, and operating rhythms across teams</li>
                <li>Managing multi-million-dollar budgets, forecasts, and vendor commitments</li>
                <li>Coordinating internal teams and external partners across multiple venues</li>
                <li>Serving as the primary escalation point for risk, scope changes, and decision-making</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Work</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Built and maintained an integrated master program plan aligning creative, operational, and financial milestones</li>
                <li>Designed cross-functional workflows coordinating artists, venues, production, marketing, and sponsors</li>
                <li>Established budget tracking and financial controls to manage spend against forecast</li>
                <li>Led weekly cross-functional check-ins to surface risks, resolve blockers, and maintain momentum</li>
                <li>Coordinated venue logistics, staffing plans, and production schedules across parallel locations</li>
                <li>Managed late-stage changes while protecting critical path timelines</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Outcomes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Delivered a multi-day, multi-venue festival and conference on a fixed deadline</li>
                <li>Supported programming for 150+ artists and speakers across multiple stages and venues</li>
                <li>Maintained financial discipline while operating under real-world budget constraints</li>

                <li>Strengthened cross-functional collaboration across creative, operational, and financial teams</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What I'd Do Again or Differently</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Build redundancy and escalation paths earlier for critical planning artifacts, ensuring timelines and dependencies are delivered even when individual workstreams stall</li>
                <li>Translate early guidance emphasizing creative flexibility into explicit budget ranges and approval checkpoints sooner, ensuring teams have clarity while maintaining financial predictability and reducing post-event variance</li>
                <li>Preserve lightweight documentation from early phases to reduce late-stage decision churn</li>
            </ul>
