            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>Hartke Presents operates a portfolio of live music programs spanning venue operations, touring initiatives, festivals, and client collaborations. Workstreams run concurrently and year-round, each with distinct timelines, budgets, stakeholders, and operational risk profiles.</p>
            <p>The portfolio includes initiatives such as D-Tour, a collaborative booking program connecting independent venues and artists across markets, alongside ongoing venue operations and seasonal programming. The operating environment requires balancing creative objectives with financial discipline while maintaining predictable delivery across shared resources and external partners.</p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Managing a portfolio of concurrent programs with overlapping timelines and shared resources</li>
                <li>Establishing operating rhythms, planning artifacts, and execution standards across workstreams</li>
                <li>Owning budgets, forecasts, and financial controls across programs</li>
                <li>Coordinating internal teams, venue operators, touring partners, vendors, and collaborators</li>
                <li>Identifying risks, resolving dependencies, and reallocating resources as priorities shifted</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Work</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and maintained portfolio-level planning to track timelines, dependencies, and capacity across initiatives</li>
                <li>Standardized workflows for budgeting, contracting, scheduling, and reporting</li>
                <li>Built financial tracking and forecasting models to support decision-making and cost discipline</li>
                <li>Led cross-functional coordination across operations, production, marketing, and finance</li>
                <li>Acted as escalation point when programs conflicted on scope, timing, or resource allocation</li>
                <li>Balanced long-term operational stability with short-term execution demands</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Outcomes</h2>
            <ul>

                <li>Improved predictability and visibility across parallel workstreams</li>
